## Programmer

First and formost I have been a coder for the last 25 years. I have programmed in many
languages, environments, and domains. I have spent most of my time on ...

### Python

From web development, scientific programming, data science and even personal utility
scripts python is my go to language for over 25 years. Yes, I do have memories of 
programming in python 1.x.

Web development is how I payed my bills, I started out in ancient times with zope, 
and jumped to better and better frameworks. From zope, I jumped to pylons and then to
django and then to flask. Currently I'm heavly inclined towards fastAPI and its 
ecosystem.

### Data science

### Personal Utility

I belive in "Automate the boring stuff" philosophy. This for me takes the form of
may python scripts / utilites.


### Java Script

I have been doing JS for a long time now. Started with JQuery and DOJO, then moved
to Backbone.js then to angular.js. Now I primaraly code in React and Angular.io with
exposure to Vue.js.

### Java (JVM)

Most of my paid work was on the Java platform in the late 2000s to the early 2010s.
I remember the drugeery by it did pay well. I gave up on the Java language almost a
decade ago in favour of scala.

As the ecosystem of other JVM languages emerged, Scala is now my default for working on
the JVM. I keep an active eye on Clojure which is elegant, and Kotlin.

### Ruby

### Golang
